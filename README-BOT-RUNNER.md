# ðŸš€ GET YOUR BOT RESPONDING RIGHT NOW

## The Problem
Vercel (serverless) cannot run persistent Discord bots. Your bot is "connected" in the database but no Discord client is actually running.

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get Your Bot Token
1. Go to your Commandless app at https://commandless.app
2. Find your bot's token (you created it when adding the bot)

### Step 2: Run the Bot Locally
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install discord.js node-fetch

# Set your bot token (replace with your actual token)
export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="your_bot_token_here"

# Run the bot
node run-bot-locally.js
```

### Step 3: Test It
1. Go to your Discord server
2. Mention your bot: `@YourBot ban @user for spamming`
3. Bot should respond with AI-powered commands!

## Alternative: Edit the File Directly
If you don't want to use environment variables:

1. Open `run-bot-locally.js`
2. Replace `'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE'` with your actual bot token
3. Run: `node run-bot-locally.js`

## What This Does
- âœ… Connects to Discord with your bot token
- âœ… Listens for mentions and replies
- âœ… Sends messages to Commandless AI for processing
- âœ… Executes Discord commands (ban, kick, etc.)
- âœ… Full natural language understanding

## PERMANENT SOLUTION (coming soon)
Railway auto-deployment will handle this automatically, but for now this gets your bot working immediately.
